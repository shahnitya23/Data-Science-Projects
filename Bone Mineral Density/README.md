**# Bone Mineral Density#**

The regression dataset shows HR-pQCT data for 200 subjects. It features radial and tibial data with features including bone mineral density (total, cortical, trabecular),
trabecular bone volume / total volume, bone thickness (trabecular, cortical), trabecular number, trabecular separation, cortical porosity, and area (total, cortical, 
trabecular). Bone mineral density is chosen as a target since it is the most clinically relevant, used in other imaging modalities to diagnose osteoporosis.
