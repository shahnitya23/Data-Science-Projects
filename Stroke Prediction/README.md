# **Stroke Detection - Predictive Model**

Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. Every 3.5 minutes, someone dies of stroke. Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. That's *a lot* of people!!

Hence, stroke predictive modelling using Machine Learning has become a big deal! It would allow medical staff to be able to treat potential stroke patients promptly, and avoid irreversiable damage or death to the individual!

The dataset I have used as the relevant information and identifier often used by medical practitioners, required to predict the chances of a stroke. 

This dataset lists all the relevant information required to predict stroke chances and these identifiers are often used by medical practitioners as well. These input parameters can be used to predict the chances of stroke in a patient.

For my model I have applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) to solve this problem. SVM is the most extensively used algorithm in the field of Healthcare because of some advantages it provides, such as, it can deliver better performance within a short period in medical assessments for small sample sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to get a hold of this algorithm which will ultimately be very useful when applying it in the healthcare industry. I performed some extensive exploratory data analysis and honed my EDA skills as well.

*Note: The dataset for this model was acquired from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).*
