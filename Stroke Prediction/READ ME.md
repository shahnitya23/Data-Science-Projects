# **Stroke Detection - Predictive Model**

Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. Every 3.5 minutes, someone dies of stroke. 
Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. That's *a lot* of people!!

Hence, stroke predictive modelling using Machine Learning has become a big deal! It would allow medical staff to 
be able to treat potential stroke patients promptly, and avoid irreversiable damage or death to the individual!

For my model I have applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) to solve this problem. SVM is the most extensively used 
algorithm in the field of Healthcare because of some advantages it provides, such as, it can deliver better 
performance within a short period in medical assessments. Therefore, it is necessary to get a hold of this algorithm 
which will ultimately be very useful when applying it in the healthcare industry. I performed some extensive 
exploratory data analysis and honed my EDA skills as well.

*Note: The dataset for this model was acquired from Kaggle.*
