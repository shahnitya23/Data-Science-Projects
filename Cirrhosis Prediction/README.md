# **Liver cirrhosis - Prediction Model**

Liver cirrhosis is a fatal condition, as there is no cure to it. Liver cirrhosis is the scrring of the liver usually caused by long-term liver damage. Due to the 
scarring, the liver cannot function properly and can lead more complications such as: infection, electrolyte deficiencies and bleeding.

Liver cirrhosis is a widespread problem especially in North America due to high intake of alcohol. In this project, I have predicted liver cirrhosis in a patient 
based on certain lifestyle and health conditions of the patient.

The dataset I have used is available on Kaggle which was collected from the Mayo Clinic trial. The dataset has about 20 features, relating to the patient’s details 
like age, sex, etc. and patient’s blood tests like prothrombin, triglycerides, platelets levels, etc. All these factors help in understanding a patient’s chances of 
liver cirrhosis.

I used the Random Forest Classifier, as well as the XGBoost Classifiers for this model. I trained and tested both models with the data, and made a decision based on 
the scores of the model. I used some exploratory data analysis and visualizations to understand the data better.
